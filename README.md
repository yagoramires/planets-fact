# Planets Facts Site

<p align="center">![STATUS](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-CONCLU%C3%8DDO-green)</p>

## Brief
Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local data.json file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

## Features

- Languages utilized: HTML, CSS, JS and ReactJS.
- React Hooks: useEffect, useState and useContext.
- Created Components and CSS for each session.
- Full responsive Design for Mobile, Tablets and Desktop.
- My first CSS animations (that was a lot of work :joy:)
- All data was pull and converted from data.json file.
